# Storing-Numbers-in-Linked-List

Store numbers in a linked list

Write a program that lets the user enter numbers from a graphical user interface and
displays them in a text area, as shown in the figure below. Use a linked list to store the
numbers. Do not store duplicate numbers. Add the buttons Sort, Shuffle,
and Reverse to sort, shuffle, and reverse the list.
